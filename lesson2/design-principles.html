                    I felt like Wendy's front page showed Hick's law well because there aren't very many buttons to
                    click once the page is first loaded. Instead of having a bunch of specials being shown on smaller
                    images, or 4 or 5 specials scrolling by, they just have one big one.

                    I have always been impressed with how sleek Apple's pages are. They use white space really well so
                    that the focus is on their technology. Their design is very clean, with just the right amount of
                    information to pique interest. I can see why so many people like their products.

                    ABC's show page stuck out to me. I have never realized it, but having the TV show's pictures alined
                    makes it easy to scroll through and find exactly what the user is looking for. I also like that the
                    titles are centered. I think it looks better than it would be if they were centered.
